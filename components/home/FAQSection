    question: "What counts as a 'small update'?",
    answer: "Small updates include text changes, image replacements, pricing updates, adding new sections to existing pages, minor design tweaks, and bug fixes. Basically, anything that doesn't require a complete page redesign or major structural changes."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the initial setup take?",
    answer: "Most websites are completed within 7-14 days after we receive all necessary content and assets. We'll provide a detailed timeline during our initial consultation based on your specific requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel my monthly subscription?",
    answer: "Yes! There are no long-term contracts. You can cancel your monthly subscription at any time. Your website will remain live, but you won't be able to request new updates after cancellation."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need a major redesign later?",
    answer: "Major redesigns or adding complex functionality may require an additional project fee, which we'll discuss and quote separately. However, many incremental improvements can be done through your monthly updates."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide hosting?",
    answer: "Yes! Hosting is included in your monthly subscription. We use fast, secure hosting with automatic backups, SSL certificates, and 99.9% uptime guarantee."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I own my website?",
    answer: "Yes, you own all the content and we can provide you with all files if you decide to host elsewhere. However, ongoing maintenance and updates would then be your responsibility."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need more than 5 pages initially?",
    answer: "No problem! We can add additional pages to your initial setup for an extra fee. Contact us to discuss your specific needs and we'll provide a custom quote."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I request updates?",
    answer: "Simply email us with your update requests. We typically respond within 24-48 hours and most updates are completed within a few business days, depending on complexity."
